		<h4><a name="whynostaff"></a>Why are there no staff on the Hive?</h4>

		<p>On staffed talkers, certain users are granted privileges. These privileges were intended to be used responsibly, to cope with the day-to-day running of a luxury resource in a time when resources were scarce.</p>
		
		<p>The restrictions - bandwidth and disk usage, for example - are no longer a serious issue, but the staffing system has remained largely unchanged since the earliest talkers. In fact, in most modern talkers, the privilege system has expanded beyond reason, and even the most commonplace functions are 'privileged.'</p>
		
		<p>The higher staff positions usually have the power to boot other users off the talker indiscriminately. As you can imagine, this has all led to many petty arguments, over often very minor incidents, and cronyism, as administrators promote their friends as staff rather than users who would be good at the job.</p>

		
		<p>The result is actually a more chaotic environment. Many people chosen for staff have no aptitude for the role: coders are frequently staff, for example. Apply this to the real world. Would a computer programmer automatically make a good policeman?</p>
		
		<p>We believe in equality for all our users, and having staff makes some users 'more equal' than others. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="whatifabuse"></a>So what happens then if I am getting abused by someone?</h4>

		<p>Simple. Use ignore. It works! Most people who are causing trouble do it for a response, whether it's to annoy you, or, on staffed talkers, to wind the staff up. Putting them on ignore does the trick every single time. Often if they are being exceptionally idiotic, everyone else will join you in ignoring them. The result is that no one listens to their silly ranting and they eventually give up.</p>

		
		<p>Our ignore command is extremely advanced, unlike most talkers. You can ignore public, private or social communication by anyone, and also ignore their complete existance, meaning you won't see them log on, or in user activity lists.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="anothernewbie"></a>But they could just log on as another newbie and continue surely?</h4>

		<p>We stress that this doesn't happen often. In the event that it does, it is easy to see, and you can continue to place them on ignore. There is an option to ignore all newbies, if this extremely unlikely scenario occurs excessively. There is also a limit to the number of newbies that can connect at once, so eventually they will have to come to a stop.</p>
		
		<p>If they are on ignore in practice we find they just won't bother. Even idiots have other matters to attend to, they can't just sit on the talker all day causing trouble, and if they do not provoke a response, then they stop.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="savedcharacters"></a>What's to stop them continuing with saved characters?</h4>

		<p>Time. You need ten minutes login time to save a character. In our experience, no one is going to bother wasting time logging in lots of different characters and then obtaining residency. Idiots have short attention spans, and once they realise that everyone is ignoring their puerility then they will just either grow up or leave.</p>
		
		<p>As for the issue of filling up disk space with multiple characters, in this day and age, disk space is hardly at a premium. Besides you could encounter the same problem by having 'too many' perfectly normal users.</p>
	</li>
	<li>

		<h4><a name="admincommands"></a>I have noticed there are admin commands on the Hive. So your ideas of equality are in fact a load of balderdash, right?</h4>

		<p>Not at all. Unfortunately computers are not infallible, and neither is software. All talkers need rebooting at some stages, and new code needs to be installed. There is a world of difference between preserving the availability and stability of a service, and jailing someone for one minute.</p>
		
		<p>Given the unstable nature of modern hardware, ISPs, and operating systems, some human maintenance is needed. The admin commands allow the loading and unloading of code and reboot of the talker. There are no privileged disciplinary commands on the talker, and all users may inspect them: see 'help admin' for more details.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="freetalk"></a>You claim to be a 'freetalk'. What one person finds acceptable another may be offended by. How is order kept?</h4>

		<p>Firstly if someone is offended they can simply ignore the offensive party. However the group system allows many different groups to be created. If you find yourself being constantly ignored due to your use of bad language, for example, you can create a group and talk to your friends on that using whatever expletives you like. In the same way if by some surprising reason you find the majority of topics in the default group offensive, you can just muffle the group and set up your own, so you and your friends can chat away without interruption from 'questionable' material. With The Hive, you can choose what you see and what you don't, the control is in your hands, not those of a member of staff.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="joingroup"></a>So what's to stop troublemakers from joining my group and causing trouble?</h4>

		<p>Groups can be invite-only, or moderated, and of course ignore can easily be used as well. As for moderation going against the theory of equality, seeing as anyone can set up a moderated group this argument is blown out of the water. In practice we find that moderated groups are not needed, but they exist if people feel the need to use them.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h4><a name="incentive"></a>Right.... So what's the point of going on a talker if I cannot work my way up the ranks? I would have no incentive to spod surely!</h4>

		<p>The incentive to spod should be to meet new people, to help the community develop, and possibly even end up sharing a few ales with us sometime in the future. Ask yourself why you want to 'work your way up the ranks'? You cannot change the world one bit with talkers. There is no financial incentive either. The only reasons you would wish to do this are either 1) A wish for control and power, or 2) a position of influence to improve the talker. We have no time for 1) on The Hive. As for 2) anyone can put forward ideas and code to improve the talker. Many different people have helped code for the talker, from small games and diversions, to complex socket and crash recovery code. It is co-operation not competition.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="features"></a>As The Hive is being actively developed, who decides what features to implement and what is suitable to be part of the talker?</h4>

		<p>Discussion on the development of the talker takes place on the public group 'hivedev'. Anyone is free to join and contribute. Code is developed by volunteers and is released freely under the terms of the GNU General Public License, anyone is welcome to submit code to become part of the talker.</p>
		
		<p>Any code that provides new functionality or improves existing features is welcomed, on the condition that it adheres to the guiding principles of the talker. This means that there should be nothing that gives extra functionality to a privileged subset of the users and that the code should be released under the GNU GPL so that others may learn from it, improve it and/or fix bugs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="offensivesocials"></a>Anyone can create socials? So what's to stop someone creating offensive ones?</h4>

		<p>What's to stop someone being offensive in communication? It requires less effort than making socials! The answer is in the ignore command. You can ignore socials altogether, socials created by someone, a specific social or socials executed by someone. Advanced ignore means you can see what you want by who you want, rather than what a member of staff may dictate.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><a name="inviteonly"></a>A staffless talker can only work by invite only, surely?</h4>

		<p>Rubbish! What's to stop someone inviting offensive people on, and for them to invite more offensive people on also? Invite offers no real protection against determined idiots, and furthermore it places an additional barrier in the way of genuine new users wishing to connect, which may encourage them to go elsewhere.</p>
		
		<p>One of the many problems new people find with talkers is 'becoming one of the crowd'. If there is a barrier before they even come on, then it's just going to hinder the development of a user base.</p>
