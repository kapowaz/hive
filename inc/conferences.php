<h2>Conferences</h2>

<p>Us regular bees are a sociable lot, and in The Hive tradition we like to meet up to share a few ales and recount tales of yore. So far there have been two Annual Hive Conferences, with a third scheduled for later in the year.</p>

<h3>The Third Annual Hive Conference (21st December 2002, Kidderminster)</h3>

<?php /*
<p>After much deliberating and debating, the venue has finally been settled on as Kidderminster, Worcestershire. This fine and friendly town is nestled in the hills between Birmingham and Worcester.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em> The conference is scheduled to start at roughly 3pm. If you are travelling a long distance you may wish to arrive between 1pm and 2pm so as to give time to travel back to drop sleeping gear off. If so, please talk to dark to make arrangements.</p>

<p><em>Travelling by car:</em> If travelling from the north, get off the M5 at Junction 4a (Bromsgrove) then drive through Bromsgrove and take the A448 to Kidderminster. From the south, get off the M5 at Junction 6 (Worcester) and take the A449 north via Ombersley.</p>

<p><em>Travelling by train:</em> Kidderminster is situated on the Birmingham - Hereford rail line, operated by Central Trains. From the north  and south-east the best route is to change at Birmingham New Street, or walk across to Birmingham Snow Hill and then get a train to Kidderminster from either of these stations. From the south west you may find it quicker to change at Worcester Foregate Street or Worcester Shrub Hill.</p>

<p><em>Travelling by TARDIS:</em> If you need help with how to get to Kidderminster via TARDIS then you are probably not qualified to use one.</p>

<p><em>Accomodation:</em> If you are travelling a long way and cannot make the return journey on the same night, there are a limited number of spaces for people to stay over locally. Please contact dark for further information. Alternatively there are several high quality Bed and Breakfasts locally. Again contact dark for further information.</p>

<p>Continuing with a roughly Midlands-esque theme, the third and final Hive Conference of 2002 took place in a damp and dark Kidderminster. Despite the excellent travel instructions posted on this very website, some people <em>still</em> managed to get lost en route, and so it was after 4pm by the time the vast majority of attendees had congregated at the residence of dark and kebaB.</p>

<p>After that initial hitch, a beeline was made for the centre of Kidderminster, whereupon The Taphouse, Penny Black, Seven Stars and The Taphouse (again) were visited. Much merrymaking was had with plenty of ales and flavoured vodka shots consumed.</p>

<p>Eventually kebaB succeeded in purloining a First Midland Red bus by bribing the driver, and all travelled back home to dark &amp; kebaB's place, where the real purpose behind the meet was revealed: multiplayer Halo!</p>

<h3>The Second Annual Hive Conference (3rd August 2002, Leicester)</h3>

<p>Leicester was the venue for the second conference. Despite a minor incident involving Whippet, and Bobbydavro and Dawkenne unable to attend at the last minute, a laugh was had by all. Pubs visited included The Wyvern, The Barley Mow, The Black Boy, The Hogshead, The Pump & Tap and Bar Gaudi. Drinking went on well into the small hours, and was supplemented with a few games of Othello and even a bash on the 'legendary' heraldry machine.</p>

<p>Grimace, JKage, Ace, Flux, Kebab, Dark, Zub, Seagull, Jen, Sockeye and a friend of ours, Pirate Pete all joined in the drinking. Whippet also appeared briefly, no doubt many of you have heard the story behind it!</p>

<h3>The First Annual Hive Conference (5th January 2002, Coventry)</h3>

<p>The first conference was held on a wet Saturday afternoon in Coventry. Many pubs were visited including The Rocket, The Aardvark and The 'Butt Treat' for the partaking of ales, and Coventry's finest kebabs were also sampled.</p>

<p>Attendance was good with Ace, Asaz, Seagull, Grimace, NutNut. Sockeye, Shania, SheGod, Kebab, JKage and Flux all putting in an appearance. Additionally we were joined by two non hivers, Lisa and Becky. Grimace and Kebab even took turns singing, and the dice got a good roll in the pub!</p>
